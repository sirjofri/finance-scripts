.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fin-add
prompts the user for record data. It asks for a \fIdescription\fR and a

be taken. The program then asks the user for the \fIamount\fR and finally
additional information. These information can be used to filter the records.
Please note that the valid record is printed to \fIstderr\fR, so you must
redirect the correct file descriptor (\fB2>>\fR).
