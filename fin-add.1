.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fin-add
prompts the user for record data. It asks for a \fIdescription\fR and a
\fIdate\fR. If the user hits enter at the date prompt, the current date will

additional information. These information can be used to filter the records.

you need to use the correct FD redirector (\fI>\fR overwrites, \fI>>\fR
appends).
