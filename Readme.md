Finance Scripts
===============

This package provides scripts that help me see my finance input and output.

Usage
-----

This package comes with 3 different `(g)awk` scripts. These scripts to _not_
directly work with files, they just receive records form `stdin` and write to
`stdout`/`stderr`.

`fin-month` parses the input records and outputs some monthly statistics about
them.

`fin-year` parses the output from `fin-month` and outputs some yearly
statistics.

`fin-add` is an interactive script. It prompts the user for record data and
prints a valid record string to `stderr`!

An example procedure is presented here:

```bash
fin-add 2>testrecords.txt              # interactive user input
fin-add 2>>testrecords.txt             # interactive user input
fin-month <testrecords.txt             # prints monthly statistics
fin-month <testrecords.txt | fin-year  # prints yearly statistics
```

Feel free to use Unix tools like `grep`, `cat` and shell functions to improve
your experience!

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

You need `make`, `gzip` (for man pages) and `gawk` (for running the scripts).

Use the given Makefile:

```bash
sudo make install
```

To only install the scripts (or manpages) use `sudo make install-bin` (or
`sudo make install-man`).

To uninstall use:

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

This removes all files except this directory. You can safely remove this
directory without damaging your system.
